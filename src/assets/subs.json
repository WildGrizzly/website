Two of which are with an array and with pointers. The type of implementation effects the efficiency of the common methods of the linked list. The most common methods include: clear, add/insert, delete, and size. However the linkedlists can be highly customizable to achieve a particular goal. The implementations of these particular linkedlists can be found on my github page."
