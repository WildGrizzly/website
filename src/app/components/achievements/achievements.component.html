        There are quite a few feats that I have accomplished

        Tech Robotics Programming team, graduating high school
        from Frankfurt Internation School and receiving not
        only a high school diploma, but also a International
        Baccalaureate certificate. Also becoming an intern at
        Atos Information Technology company, and maintaining a
